# grattex
This is the repository containing the configuration files for reports in the style of the [Grattan Institute, Melbourne](https://grattan.edu.au/).

See https://github.com/grattan/grattex/blob/master/doc/grattexDocumentation.pdf for the documentation.

## Starting a new report
Staff starting a new report need to "clone the `grattex` repository on Github" (copy the report template) and "import the repository to edit in Overleaf" (open the template in Overleaf). This can be done using the following steps.

### [Once only]: Create your Github and Overleaf accounts
If **you do not have a Github account** that is connected to the Grattan organisation:

  * Create a Github account at [github.com](https://github.com) using your @grattaninstitute email address and a username that makes it easy to identify yourself (and remember). *[Skip if you already have a Github account]*
  * Ask a LaTeXnician to add you to the Grattan Github organisation.

If **you do not have an Overleaf account**:

  * Create an Overleaf account at [overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) using your `@grattaninstitute` email address.

### Part 1: Copy the template using Github
  1. Logged into your github account, go to https://github.com/new/import.
  2. Copy `https://github.com/grattan/grattex` and paste under `Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL`.
  3. Under `Your new repository details` choose `grattan` as the owner.
  4. Under `Name` add a name to your project that will clearly identify the project now and in the future. A **good** example is `Energy-2018-stranded-assets`. A **bad** example is `he-report`.
  5. Select `Private`.
  6. Click `Begin Import`. This will take a few minutes to copy. Grab a cuppa' or a coffee from AO: Github will email you when it's finished. 
  7. Once it has finished, you have successfully cloned the `grattex` repository (copied the report template). Now it's time to open and edit it in Overleaf.

### Part 2: Open the template in Overleaf
  8. Log into your account at at [overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com).
  9. Click `New Project > Import from GitHub`.
  10. Locate the file you just created, and click `Import to Overleaf`.
  11. Once imported the document will open and attempt to compile. If it initially fails to compile, search for and delete `\nocite{*}` from `Report.tex`.
  12. At the top right, click `Share` and:
       + add collaborators via their email address. *Please add all the LaTeXnicians (Will, Kate, James and Hugh)* as well as the members of your team, and Paul and Kat.
       + copy the `Anyone with this link can edit the project` link and paste it
    just under `\documentclass{grattan}` as a comment, *i.e.*
    
```latex
    \documentclass{grattan}
    % Anyone with this link can edit the project:
    % https://www.overleaf.com/abcdefghi12345
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that your coauthors can also invite people to edit the document in your absence
    
  13. And that's it. You've now created a new report on Github and Overleaf.

## Working with LaTeX
You can get a long way in Latex using Overleaf's 'Rich Text' editor. When you open an Overleaf project and select a file ending in `.tex` from the left sidebar, code will appear in the centre panel of the screen. At the top left of the code is a toggle button, allowing you to see the file as 'Source' code (which looks code-ish) or 'Rich Text' (which looks a bit more like Microsoft Word, including buttons you can click for section heading or bold text).

Now you can write almost as easily as you would in more user-friendly text editors like Word.

For anything more advanced (footnotes, referencing, tables, figures and other miscellaneous troubleshooting), there are three resources that might help.

  1. __Using LaTeX in reports at Grattan__ is a more-than-one-hundred page document that should contain the answer. It lives in the Grattan Dropbox under `Grattan Team > Templates > LaTeX > grattexDocumentation.pdf`. While super helpful and comprehensive, the document is very long --- the best strategy is to `ctrl+F` for whatever you need assistance with.
  2. The __latexShowcase__ project in Overleaf contains many examples of code that you might find useful, including how to use boxes and complex tables. Ask Will Mackey to invite you to this project if you didn't already receive the invite during your induction.
  3. Your colleagues have probably encountered any issues you might have. Breaking a Latex document can be unnerving and frustrating, but the fix usually takes only a few seconds. Ask around! __Will, James and Kate__ are the designated 'Latexnicians' as of November 2019, and are more than happy to help.
